    * The **Domain Name System (DNS)** serves as a fundamental component of the internet infrastructure, translating user-friendly domain names into their corresponding IP addresses.
    * When you input a domain name into your web browser, the DNS is responsible for finding the associated IP address and directing your request to the appropriate server.
    * This process commences with your computer sending a query to a **recursive resolver**, which then searches a series of DNS servers, beginning with the root server, followed by the **Top-Level Domain (TLD)** server, and ultimately the **authoritative name server**.
    * Once the IP address is located, the recursive resolver returns it to your computer, allowing your browser to establish a connection with the target server and access the desired content.
