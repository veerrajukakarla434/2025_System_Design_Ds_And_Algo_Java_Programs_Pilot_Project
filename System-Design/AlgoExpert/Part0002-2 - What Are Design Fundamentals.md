# 2 - What Are Design Fundamentals

* Building scalable, production-ready applications is both art and science. Science, in that it requires knowledge of many topics in computer engineering; art, in that it demands an eye for making smart design choices and piecing together the right technologies.

* Master both disciplines and you, too, can become a Systems Expert.
* This video is given or categorized system design as 4 types as his point of view
     1) Underlying fundational knowldge  like **clien-server model** and **network protocalls**
     2) Key characteristics of a system like
         * Avalability
         * Throughput
         * Redundancy
         * Consistency

   3) Actual components of system
        * Load Balancer
        * Proxies
        * Cache's
        * Leader Election
        * Rate Limiting ...etc
     
   4) Actuval Tect (Real existing tools)
       * zookeper
       * XCD, Unix,Amazone-S3, GCP-Storage...etc
