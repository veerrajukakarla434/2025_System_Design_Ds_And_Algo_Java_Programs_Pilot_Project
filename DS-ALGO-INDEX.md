* Once you learned from the above algrithm like arreay, linked list .... line wise
* Start doing problems on arrays **easy**- top 5 problems with hight acceptance (80 to 90 *) (leet code)
* Start doing problems on arrays **easy**-  5 problems with next acceptance (40 to 50 *) (leet code)
* Start doing problems on arrays **medium**- top 5 problems with hight acceptance (80 to 90 *) (leet code)
* Start doing problems on arrays **medium**- 5 problems with next acceptance (30 to 70 *) (leet code)
* Start doing problems on arrays **hard**- 3 or 4 problems with hight acceptance (80 to 90 *) (leet code)
* Do the same thing for all DS and Algorithms
